## INTRODUCTION
---------------
The work day scheduler is a simple calendar app that allows users to see the hours of the day, color coded in relation to the current time, and input events to schedule their day. 

## REQUIREMENTS
--------------
N/A


## FUNCTIONALITY
----------------
The live site for the application can be found at: https://august-lascola.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/
Upon loading the page, the user will be met with a color coded grid, showing the hours of the day. 

Upon clicking one of the time boxes, the user will be able to input a task for them to do. 

Future functionality will allow for the user to store their tasks in localstorage, so that they can be retrieved when refreshing the page.
